# Reaction Commere Core Theme
`meteor add reactioncommerce:core-theme`

This is the base Reaction Commerce theme. It contains all the LESS files used by the `reactioncommerce:core` build process to generate custom LESS files in the [Reaction Commerce](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) application.

For customization of Reaction, you can edit the files generated by this package, and override anything created here.

#Bootstrap
This package assumes installation of Bootstrap LESS files, and includes additional mixins and variables in the `default` folder.

#Theme Development
You can clone this package to create additional theme packages for Reaction Commerce. There are a number of placeholder files that should be sufficient for theming.

# Changing Structure
If you add or delete files, run

    ./build-package.sh

This will update the file list in packages.js

However, any files that are not already included must also be updated in the `reactioncommerce:core` `/server/buildtools/module-definitions.js` file, as this defines what files are included for each theme module.
